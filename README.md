# React Native FlatList Performance Optimization

This repository demonstrates a common performance issue in React Native when using FlatList with large datasets and provides a solution for optimization. 

The initial code exhibits significant lag due to inefficient rendering. The solution implements techniques like `windowSize` and potentially `getItemLayout` to enhance performance dramatically.  See the code for details.
