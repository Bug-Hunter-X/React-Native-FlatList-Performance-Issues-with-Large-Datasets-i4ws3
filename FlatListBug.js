This React Native code snippet attempts to render a FlatList with a large dataset, but it results in performance issues and lag:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={largeDataset} // largeDataset contains a very large array of items
  renderItem={({ item }) => <ListItem item={item} />}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
/>
```

The `ListItem` component might also be complex, further contributing to slow rendering.  The key problem is the lack of optimization for rendering a large number of items.
